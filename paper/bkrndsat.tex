\subsection{Incremental Satisfiability Solvers}
\label{bk-sat}
%%% Intro
This section will give a brief overview of the internals of incremental
satisifiability solvers that VSMT manipulates. The solver presented in this
paper only manipulates the underlying solver via an smtlib2
interface~\cite{BarFT-SMTLIB}, specifically using the \addcitation{for data.sbv}
Data.SBV haskell library.

% SMT Lib assertion stack description
Smtlib compliant incremental sat solvers store boolean formulae in a global
stack called an \textit{assertion-set stack}. An assertion includes variables,
definitions of variables, logical formulae and function symbols. For example,
all of the following are legal assertions that could be placed on an assertion
stack:
\begin{align*}
  x == True \\
  x \wedge y \geq \pi \\
  y + 2 * z == 1729
\end{align*}
