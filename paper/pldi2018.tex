%% Abstract
%% Note: \begin{abstract}...\end{abstract} environment must come
%% before \maketitle command
\begin{abstract}
  Many program analyses can be reduced to satisfiability (SAT) problems, or more
  generally, to satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) problems. For example, dead
  code analysis can be formulated in terms of whether or not a particular
  conjunction of conditions is satisfiable. \change{reword this again, it still
    doesn't feel direct enough} In the context of explicit variability, such as
  when analyzing software product lines or when introducing alternative
  variations for counterfactual or migrational typing, we can reduce the
  corresponding analyses to variational SAT/SMT problems. However, modern
  solvers are variationally naive, thus requiring $2^n$ calls to the sat solver,
  where $n$ is the number of variational dimensions. This work presents an
  incremental VSMT solver that is variationally aware, a series of optimizations
  on variational boolean propositional formulae, an algorithm to solve such
  formulae and an empirical evaluation of the VSMT solver compared to standard
  brute force techniques. We report a \todo{report data performance speedup, or
    memory cost} in simulated data, and a \todo{same as above} in application
  data.

\section{Introduction}
Programming with explicit variation has seen successful applications in many
diverse areas of computer science \todo{add citations for, vdbms, counterfactual
  typing, variational images, spl, feature models} A fundamental operation for
each of these applications is satisfiability solving (henceforth sat solvers) to
check for type unification, a valid software product line, or a counter-factual
typing relation. Current sat solvers are variationally naive, the smtlib2
interface provides an \texttt{ite} operator to model if-then-else branching
points, but such an operator only provides naive implicit variational support.
Thus, it cannot take advantage of variational optimization rules, nor can it
return explicit variational results where such results may be desirable. This
paper describes the construction
