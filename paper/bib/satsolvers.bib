abstract="In this article, we present a small, complete, and efficient SAT-solver in the style of conflict-driven learning, as exemplified by Chaff. We aim to give sufficient details about implementation to enable the reader to construct his or her own solver in a very short time. This will allow users of SAT-solvers to make domain specific extensions or adaptions of current state-of-the-art SAT-techniques, to meet the needs of a particular application area. The presented solver is designed with this in mind, and includes among other things a mechanism for adding arbitrary boolean constraints. It also supports solving a series of related SAT-problems efficiently by an incremental SAT-interface.",

abstract="Incremental SAT solving under assumptions, introduced in Minisat, is in wide use. However, Minisat's algorithm for incremental SAT solving under assumptions has two main drawbacks which hinder performance considerably. First, it is not compliant with the highly effective and commonly used preprocessor SatELite. Second, all the assumptions are left in the formula, rather than being represented as unit clauses, propagated, and eliminated. Two previous attempts to overcome these problems solve either the first or the second of them, but not both. This paper remedies this situation by proposing a comprehensive solution for incremental SAT solving under assumptions, where SatELite is applied and all the assumptions are propagated. Our algorithm outperforms existing approaches over publicly available instances generated by a prominent industrial application in hardware validation.",
