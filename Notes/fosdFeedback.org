* What
  This document is the debriefing document regarding the feedback I received
  from the VSAT presentation at the FOSD 2018 conference

* Direct Feedback
  - How many SAT calls are being made in actuality
  - What is the memory foot print like?
  - Read the original minisat paper for description of modern incremental SAT solving
  - Check out the presence condition simplification by sven: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194572/
  - Could perhaps fork typeChef and integrate with VSAT
  - Choice decomposition is called variability encoding or configuration lifting depending on the domain.

* Applications
  - old covarity with static analysis. This is a paper from the early 2000s on
    how to encode C programs into Sat
  - Data Flow analysis may be a good application for VSAT
  - Monotone frameworks for static analysis
  - Chip solvers
